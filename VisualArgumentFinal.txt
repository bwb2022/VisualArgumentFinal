My visual argument is bringing awareness to mental health, and the struggles that some people go through. This visual argument includes the word “Ask” which is telling the viewer to not stand by and watch. If someone does not want to be alone, they should not need to be or feel alone. 

Tools I used were snip, scale, cut, paste, pallet, gradient, and text.

Visual design elements are the contrasting colors from the text and image to the background. This draws the focus to both of these items. The dark color is for like a sad affect, where the viewer may feel sad because black is a sad color.
